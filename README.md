# UX 
This project is meant to provide guidance to young graduates as well as university and college students. 

## User stories

# DEPLOYMENT
## Workspace preview deployment
During work on the workspace, it is saved using the ctrl+S and the website is deployed externally for review using the code:
- python3 -m http.server

## open deployment
After the work is saved, it will be finally deployed in these steps:
- git add -A: this add all the files currently to the repository
- git status: this check the status of the website
- git commit -m "message": this allows for the commit of any files added
- git push: this send the changes to the repository

# TESTING

## Browsing DevOp inspection tools 

- Google Chrome inspection tool 

- Mozilla Inspection tool (Note: there was a problem with the outlook of the Home page. This is due to overlap between the navbar insertions and the ul li elements. This is now resolved). 

- Validation website for indicating CSS and HTML problems:  http://validator.w3.org 

- Validation website for CSS errors only: https://autoprefixer.github.io/ 

- Mobile Dev tools 

- All Samsung Galaxy series 

- All iPhone series 

- All iPhone series 

- All iPad Touch series 

- Moto G4 

- All Nexus series  

- All Nokia series 

- All Pixel series 

## Mobile Browsing tools 

- Google Chrome 

- Safari Browser 

- Mozilla Firefox 

## Results from using inspecting tools
The web page on Chrome has a good outlook. However based on other web browsing platforms (e.g. Mozilla Firefox) as well as Physical mobile platforms the outlook is awkward.
[Just like this](https://oprdqw.db.files.1drv.com/y4m-w4taW3EG9o6HSsmNsR5_Gz9so5TzQsv4_lq_6c9mHb3vPdWRl2deBLJXaSWBjR7QrsIq4Ql4fSKF_sjvDcZODALMyxUm2h5T52Sd-271xdGrrgG3D-3oEqUJ4IbD6loVH3Z9jQFnPjaS-4FQ_l_9-k9zKMbE0gSKNmKISsgD16WEi4Skspx3SMhRcDxUfZPMVfbgPW6cCBlOJBYaIIg_A?width=1366&height=768&cropmode=none)


This is because while the floating pattern do not affect the web page on Chrome, unexpectedly it affects all other browsing platforms. Also it is even affected on the Chrome browser on other workstations and desktops. 

##  Results of testing using Pigdom 

The result tells me that the website is set up correctly. 

The uptime result is presented [here](https://my.pingdom.com/data/report/uptime/6166901?from=2020-06-01T01%3A20%3A08Z&to=2020-06-08T01%3A20%3A08Z)
